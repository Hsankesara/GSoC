## Communicating with the mentors

**We use Slack as the main medium of communications.** Join us on Slack by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKNZ-QonmxNkekDMLLbP-b_IrNHyDRuQValBy1BAsLOjEFpg/viewform) and connect with your potential mentors to discuss your project ideas. Please introduce yourself to the community and indicate that you are interested in participating the GSoC program. You will be guided to the specific channel/mentor(s). 

- English will be the main language of communication.

- Please try to avoid individual messages to the mentors in DMs (unless specifically mentioned by the mentor) and try to use the channels for discussions.

- Please bear in mind the timezone of the mentors and you, before making a direct contact or mentions.

## Project size and flexibility
GSoC 2022 allows contributors have some flexibility to choose between **full-time** (35 hours a week and 350 hours in total, a large project) and **half-time** (about 18 hours a week and 175 hours in total, a medium-size project). 

Each project is marked with a level of complexity and required effort to build. Some projects may have low level of complexity, but may require more time to complete.

We have indicated how we see a project's size and complexity. Some projects **may have some flexibility to change the scope** and complexity as the contributor and mentor see fit. Please note that these estimates are just an indication and each contributor can and should evaluate and propose their own estimate of full-time or half-time in their project proposal.
