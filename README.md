**RADAR-base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapses)** is an open source platform that leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies. The main focus of RADAR-base is seamless integration of data streams from various wearables to collect sensor data in real time and store, manage and share the collected data with researchers for retrospective analysis.

We comminucate mainly through **Slack**. For questions or comments, you may ask us in our channel. Join us on Slack by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKNZ-QonmxNkekDMLLbP-b_IrNHyDRuQValBy1BAsLOjEFpg/viewform): 

## About the Platform

The platform provides both passive and active data collection via two applications. Passive data collection using passive remote monitoring technologies (pRMT) application. It includes real time monitoring of movement, location, app usage, among others. Passive collection can be done by directly sending data from phone sensors or device sensor data through the app or device sensor data via cloud storage to RADAR-base (or both). See the list of supported devices [here](https://radar-base.org/index.php/data-sensors/supported-devices/).

Active data collection using the active Remote Monitoring Technologies (aRMT) app, which includes the use of questionnaires that might ask patients about their mood, medication intake, or the severity of symptoms. All of the collected data can be extracted from the platform in structured formats.

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the platform:
