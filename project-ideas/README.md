**RADAR-base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapses)** is an open source platform that leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies. Below is a list of project ideas.

## Project Ideas

### Management Portal

**[1] Organization and Project Archival and Export**

**Overview**: At the moment archival of organisation and project entities are not easy or possible in Management portal. We should have a way to archive projects that are not ongoing and potentially a data export for retrospective analysis.

### Dashboards

**[1] Patient/participant Dashboard**

**Overview**: A web-based & mobile friendly Visualisation of passive and active data. Complete the loop of collecting data and passing this or processed/aggregated versions of the data back to the participant.
